To understand the governing terms, review Adobe's Generative AI User Guidelines. To understand Adobe's data handling practices, see Content usage and handling practices. The AI-powered features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support multiple document types, including PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, and RTF files. AI Assistant supports Microsoft Teams and Zoom meeting transcripts. The capabilities improve comprehension and save time across various document types. AI Assistant quickly gets answers to your questions based on your documents in a comprehensive and informative way. It can analyze multiple documents to uncover similarities, differences, and key patterns. With AI Assistant, you can make targeted requests, such as highlighting the differences between PDF contracts. It links to text and data table sources within the document. It also suggests follow-up questions for you based on the primary question. AI Assistant uses the latest AI language model, GPT 4o, to provide more accurate and clear answers to your queries based on more citations. It can extract information accurately from tables and complex documents. Generative summary automatically provides an outline with headings and summaries to highlight key points in the document. The feature generates key insights that help you easily comprehend the PDF content. For a speedier response, it processes PDF content in chunks and simultaneously streams summaries. You can access the generative AI features in Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Acrobat desktop on both Windows and macOS, on Acrobat online, and within Acrobat extensions for Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. AI Assistant is also available on phones through Acrobat mobile apps (iOS and Android). It isn't available on iPad or Android tablets.",

      "refined_text": "Attributions When the AI Assistant analyzes a document, it identifies sentences most likely to support the answer to your question. Attribution can take the form of clickable citations or other helpful cues indicating where generated information came from. However, because the AI Assistant is powered by generative AI models, and the technology is still evolving and not perfect, not all answers are helpful or accurate. As a result, the AI Assistant may not find and display answers to your questions — even when the information is in your document. And rarely, the AI Assistant may provide incorrect attributions. For example, you may receive a clickable citation or cue that takes you to an unrelated section instead of providing helpful information on where the answer came from in the document. Please double-check all AI-generated responses. Please note that in our current version, if the language of the question and response is different than the language of your document, AI Assistant won't provide any attribution. In such scenarios, you can try asking questions in the language of the document to receive clickable citations in the response.",

      "refined_text": "What’s the best way to create a PDF? You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign® files, digital images, and more. Diﬀerent types of sources have diﬀerent tools available for PDF conversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in the Print dialog box. If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft Excel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is already open, you don’t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. Every PDF balances eﬃciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the balance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an appropriate conversion method. For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat applies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings. If you want more control over the process, you’ll want to use another method.",
